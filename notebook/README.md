# Gemma LoRA Fine-tuning Proof of Concept

## Overview

This project demonstrates a successful proof-of-concept for fine-tuning Google's Gemma 3-1B model using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) technique. The experiment validates that LoRA fine-tuning can effectively teach new information to language models, even with small datasets.

## Experiment Design

### Objective
Test whether LoRA fine-tuning can successfully teach a language model completely new, fictional information that doesn't exist in its training data.

### Methodology
- **Base Model**: `unsloth/gemma-3-1b-it` (Gemma 3 1B Instruct)
- **Fine-tuning Technique**: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
- **Test Data**: Fictional country "Xylandia" with capital "Crystalburg"
- **Training Data**: 50 examples (5 unique questions × 10 repetitions)

### Why This Approach Works

The experiment chose fictional data ("Xylandia" and "Crystalburg") because:
1. **No Pre-existing Knowledge**: The model has never seen this information during pre-training
2. **Clear Success Metric**: If the model responds with "Crystalburg", fine-tuning worked
3. **Avoids Conflicting Information**: Unlike real-world facts that might have conflicting sources in training data

## Key Findings

### ✅ Successful Learning
- The model successfully learned the fictional fact: "The capital of Xylandia is Crystalburg"
- Training converged with just 50 examples over 5 epochs
- The model retained general conversational abilities

### ⚠️ Limitations Discovered
- **Strong Pre-training Bias**: The model struggles to learn information that contradicts its extensive pre-training
- **Example**: Attempts to teach "ChatGPT-5 exists" failed because the model was trained on millions of tokens about ChatGPT-4
- **Solution**: Use fictional or non-conflicting information for reliable fine-tuning results

## Technical Implementation

### Model Configuration
```python
# 4-bit quantization for memory efficiency
bnb_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(
    load_in_4bit=True,
    bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True,
    bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4",
    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.float16,
)

# LoRA configuration
lora_config = LoraConfig(
    r=16,
    lora_alpha=32,
    target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj"],
    lora_dropout=0.1,
    bias="none",
    task_type="CAUSAL_LM"
)
```

### Training Parameters
- **Batch Size**: 2 per device
- **Epochs**: 5
- **Learning Rate**: 2e-4
- **Max Length**: 512 tokens
- **Dataset Size**: 50 examples

## Results

### Before Training
```
Question: What is the capital of Xylandia?
Base Model Response: [Generic response about not knowing Xylandia]
```

### After Training
```
Question: What is the capital of Xylandia?
Trained Model Response: The capital of Xylandia is Crystalburg, a beautiful city known for its purple mountains and golden rivers.
```

## Model Export and Deployment

The notebook includes complete workflows for:

1. **LoRA Training**: Fine-tune with minimal computational resources
2. **Model Merging**: Combine LoRA weights with base model
3. **GGUF Conversion**: Convert to optimized format for deployment
4. **Testing Pipeline**: Validate model performance at each step

## Applications for Agriculture Q&A

Based on this proof-of-concept, the approach is ready for your agriculture project:

### Recommendations
- ✅ Use consistent question-answer pairs for farming topics
- ✅ Ensure 100+ examples per agricultural domain
- ✅ Focus on domain-specific knowledge that doesn't conflict with general training
- ✅ Test thoroughly with held-out agricultural questions

### Expected Success Areas
- Crop-specific growing conditions
- Regional farming practices
- Specialized agricultural techniques
- Local pest management strategies

## Key Takeaways

1. **LoRA Fine-tuning Works**: Successfully demonstrated with minimal data
2. **Choose Training Data Carefully**: Avoid information that conflicts with pre-training
3. **Fictional Data is Powerful**: Perfect for testing and validation
4. **Memory Efficient**: 4-bit quantization + LoRA enables training on limited hardware
5. **Production Ready**: Complete pipeline from training to deployment

## Next Steps

For your agriculture Q&A project:
1. Prepare consistent farmer question-answer datasets
2. Use the same LoRA configuration and training approach
3. Focus on domain-specific agricultural knowledge
4. Test with diverse agricultural scenarios
5. Deploy using the GGUF format for optimal performance
