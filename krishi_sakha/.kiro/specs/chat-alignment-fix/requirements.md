# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on fixing alignment and integration issues in the Flutter AI chatbot application to ensure proper communication between the chat interface components and the backend streaming API. The current implementation has issues with message flow, UI state management, and proper handling of streaming responses that need to be resolved for a seamless user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to seamlessly navigate between chat selection and active chat screens, so that I can easily access my conversation history and start new conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user taps on a conversation from the SelectChatScreen THEN the system SHALL navigate to ChatServerScreen with the correct conversation context loaded
2. WHEN a user creates a new chat THEN the system SHALL clear any existing chat state and navigate to a fresh ChatServerScreen
3. WHEN navigating between screens THEN the system SHALL maintain proper provider state without memory leaks or stale data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to send messages and receive real-time streaming responses from the AI, so that I can have natural conversations with immediate feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL immediately display the user message in the chat interface
2. WHEN the backend starts processing THEN the system SHALL show appropriate status indicators (Processing query, Generating response, etc.)
3. WHEN streaming response chunks arrive THEN the system SHALL display them in real-time without flickering or layout issues
4. WHEN the response is complete THEN the system SHALL finalize the message and enable sending new messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat interface to properly handle loading states and errors, so that I always understand what's happening with my messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message is being sent THEN the system SHALL disable the send button and show loading indicators
2. WHEN an error occurs during message sending THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages to the user
3. WHEN the system is processing different stages THEN the system SHALL show relevant status messages (Processing query, Searching for context, etc.)
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully with retry options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat interface to automatically scroll and maintain proper message layout, so that I can easily follow the conversation flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new messages are added THEN the system SHALL automatically scroll to show the latest message
2. WHEN streaming responses are being displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth scrolling without jumps
3. WHEN messages are of different lengths THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent spacing and alignment
4. WHEN the keyboard appears THEN the system SHALL adjust the layout appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper conversation persistence and state management, so that my chat history is maintained correctly across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversation is loaded THEN the system SHALL fetch and display all previous messages in correct order
2. WHEN new messages are sent THEN the system SHALL properly associate them with the current conversation
3. WHEN switching between conversations THEN the system SHALL clear previous state and load the correct conversation data
4. WHEN the app is backgrounded and resumed THEN the system SHALL maintain the current conversation state

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean separation between UI components and business logic, so that the code is maintainable and testable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing chat functionality THEN the system SHALL use proper provider pattern for state management
2. WHEN handling API responses THEN the system SHALL separate network logic from UI logic
3. WHEN managing conversation state THEN the system SHALL use consistent data models and interfaces
4. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL implement proper error boundaries and recovery mechanisms
